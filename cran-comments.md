## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed 2 invalid URLs and changed 1 invalid URL to its canonical form.
* Description changed to reflect that the steps refer to steps from the recipes package and listing the methods included.
* Replaced dontrun{} with donttest{}
* Package names put in single quotes in Title and Description.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.5.0
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.5.0
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
