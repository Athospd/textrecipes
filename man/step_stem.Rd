\title{Stemming of list-column variables}
\usage{
step_stem(recipe, ..., role = NA, trained = FALSE, columns = NULL,
  options = list(), stemmer = "SnowballC", skip = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables.
For `step_stem`, this indicates the variables to be encoded
into a list column. See [recipes::selections()] for more
details. For the `tidy` method, these are not currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the recipe has been
baked.}

\item{columns}{A list of tibble results that define the
encoding. This is `NULL` until the step is trained by
[recipes::prep.recipe()].}

\item{options}{A list of options passed to the stemmer}

\item{stemmer}{a character to select stemming method. Defaults
to "SnowballC".}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by [recipes::bake.recipe()]? While all
operations are baked when [recipes::prep.recipe()] is run, some
operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when
using `skip = TRUE` as it may affect the computations for
subsequent operations}
}
\value{
An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added
 to the sequence of existing steps (if any).
}
\description{
`step_stem` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that
 will convert a list of its tokenized parts into a list with its
 tokenized parts stemmed.
